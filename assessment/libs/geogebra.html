addGeogebra(applet,[width,height,commands,params,callbacks,qn,part])
<p>place a geogebra HTML5 applet.</p>
<p><b>applet</b> should be one of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"graphing", "geometry", "3d", "spreadsheet", "classic", or "probability" for a blank applet in one of those modes</li>
    <li>The applet ID for an app uploaded to geogebra.org.  For example, if the URL for the applet is
        https://www.geogebra.org/m/ws7xbhyh, the applet ID is "ws7xbhyh".  You can use applets others 
        have uploaded, or ones you upload.  To give proper attribution, include in the question 
        "Other Attribution" something like "Geogebra applet created by ____" with the creator's name.</li>
    <li>The base64ggb for an applet you created. In the applet editor, you grab this by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B</li>
</ul>
<p><b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are the dimensions in pixels for the applet. Default is 400 by 200.</p>
<p><b>commands</b> is an optional array of javascript commands to execute on the geogebra applet to 
  change the contents.  See <a href="https://geogebra.github.io/docs/reference/en/GeoGebra_Apps_API/">GeoGebra Apps API</a> 
    for available commands.  For example, <code>["evalCommand('A = ($a,$b)')","evalCommand('B = ($c,$d)')"]</code>
    would set the value of points A and B to the provided coordinates.</p>
<p><b>params</b> is an optional key=>value array of parameters, like <code>['framePossible'=>'true','showToolBar'=>'true']</code>. 
    See <a href="https://geogebra.github.io/docs/reference/en/GeoGebra_App_Parameters/">GeoGebra App Parameters</a> for options</p>
<p><b>callbacks</b> is an optional array that allows you to pull values from Geogebra on submit. The values will be stored as a 
    comma-separated list in the answerbox corresponding with <b>qn</b> and <b>part</b>. Usually you 
    will want to use <code>$thisq</code> for qn. <b>part</b> is not required for single-part questions. For example,
    <code>["getValue('a')","getValue('b')"]</code> would get the values of Geogebra variables a and b and
    store them as a comma separated list</p>
